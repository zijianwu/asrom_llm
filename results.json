However, there is a report documenting the development of substance-induced psychosis in a young patient who used a large amount of psilocybin. More research is needed to fully understand the relationship between psilocybin and psychosis. \nSOURCES: 36049313, 36048112, 35900779, 23976938, 23942028, 23784738, 22030715"

However, the study cited in the new context found that psilocybin did not disrupt processing of prediction errors (PE) in healthy subjects, unlike the NMDAR antagonist ketamine. Aberrant PE signaling is thought to contribute to the formation of cognitive impairments in schizophrenia. While psilocybin may have some effects similar to psychosis, it does not necessarily cause psychosis. Clinical studies have not found evidence that psilocybin or other psychedelics cause long-term mental health problems or are independent risk factors for mental health problems. Individuals should still use caution when using psilocybin and seek medical attention if they experience any concerning symptoms.\n\nSources:\n- 35900779\n- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6007659/\n- 23976938\n- 23942028\n- 22030715"

However, it is important to note that the incidence of emotional and behavioral disorders is high in children and adolescents with frequent episodic or chronic tension type headaches. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach including cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, biofeedback, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications may be necessary to address both the headache and the underlying emotional and behavioral disorders. Additionally, non-pharmacological interventions such as repetitive neuromuscular magnetic stimulation (rNMS) and remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) may offer safe and effective alternatives for the treatment of headache in children and adolescents. \n\nSources: 33349920, 34153363, 31317889"
