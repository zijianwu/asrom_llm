However, it is important to note that the incidence of emotional and behavioral disorders is high in children and adolescents with frequent episodic or chronic tension type headaches. Therefore, a multidisciplinary approach including cognitive-behavioral therapy, relaxation techniques, biofeedback, physical therapy, and lifestyle modifications may be necessary to address both the headache and the underlying emotional and behavioral disorders. Additionally, non-pharmacological interventions such as repetitive neuromuscular magnetic stimulation (rNMS) and remote electrical neuromodulation (REN) may offer safe and effective alternatives for the treatment of headache in children and adolescents. \n\nSources: 33349920, 34153363, 31317889"

However, it is mentioned that early diagnostic paracentesis is essential so that appropriate acute management, including antimicrobial treatment can be started. It is also suggested that in patients with cystic fibrosis, it would seem reasonable to use a wide spectrum antimicrobial agent with activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, other common Gram negative organisms, and Staphylococcus aureus. This may be for chronic (continuous) antimicrobial prophylaxis or only during periods when bacteraemia is possible (for example, dental work, bronchoscopy)."
