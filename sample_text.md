# Chronic mesenteric ischemia

## SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS

Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a rare but potentially life-threatening condition that requires prompt diagnosis and intervention [33005650]. The initial clinical stage of CMI is characterized by a sudden onset of strong abdominal pain followed by a painless interval. Biphasic contrast-enhanced CT represents the gold standard for the diagnosis of arterial and venous occlusion. Endovascular techniques for arterial occlusion have taken on a much greater importance today [33005650]. Multimodal treatment of acute mesenteric ischemia may avoid intestinal resection and is an effective prevention strategy for short bowel syndrome (SBS) [29702489]. Hormonal treatment focusing on intestinal rehabilitation by promoting intestinal hyperadaptation has been proposed in patients with SBS, who require parenteral nutrition and intravenous fluids, such as glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) analog which is now recommended by the latest European Society for Clinical Nutrition and Metabolism Guidelines [29702489].

## INTRODUCTION

Chronic mesenteric ischemia is a rare condition caused by inadequate blood flow to the intestines due to atherosclerosis of the mesenteric arteries [36327425]. Patients may present with symptoms such as postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea [36327425]. Diagnosis can be challenging, but imaging studies such as computed tomography angiography can be helpful [36327425]. Treatment options include medical management, endovascular therapy, or surgical revascularization [36327425]. In elderly patients undergoing emergency surgery for perforated bowel, functional status and chronic steroid therapy play an important role in determining survival [36652773]. COVID-19 can be responsible for both acute and chronic embolic and thrombotic events in the mesenteric vasculature, which acts as a risk factor in the manifestation of small bowel obstruction [36452880].

## ANATOMY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is caused by insufficient blood flow to the intestines due to stenosis or occlusion of the mesenteric arteries [32982262]. The most common cause of CMI is atherosclerosis, which leads to narrowing of the mesenteric arteries [32954918]. Other causes of CMI include arterial embolism, arterial thrombosis, and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia (NOMI) [32865709]. The mesenteric arteries are the primary blood supply to the small and large intestines, and their occlusion can lead to ischemia and infarction of the bowel. The symptoms of CMI include postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea. The diagnosis of CMI is made with imaging studies such as computed tomography angiography (CTA) or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA). Treatment options for CMI include medical management with antiplatelet agents and vasodilators, endovascular interventions such as angioplasty and stenting, and surgical revascularization.

## RISK FACTORS

Risk factors for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) include atherosclerosis, which can lead to stenosis or occlusion of mesenteric arteries [36749272]. Other risk factors for CMI and acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) include advanced age, chronic kidney disease, and chronic steroid use [36652773, 36963863]. In addition, patients with AMI may have a delay in diagnosis, which can result in significant complications [36963863]. It is important for healthcare professionals to be aware of these risk factors and to consider them in the diagnosis and management of CMI and AMI.

## CLINICAL PRESENTATION

### Symptoms

Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is caused by stenosis or occlusion of mesenteric arteries and can progress to potentially life-threatening acute mesenteric ischemia if left untreated [36749272]. Symptoms of CMI are often nonspecific and may include postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and diarrhea [36749272]. In some cases, patients may experience symptoms of acute mesenteric ischemia, such as severe abdominal pain and vomiting [36404451]. Diagnosis of CMI is made based on a combination of clinical symptoms, endoscopic findings, and imaging tests such as Doppler ultrasound and magnetic resonance angiography [36749272]. Early diagnosis and treatment are crucial to prevent progression to acute mesenteric ischemia [36749272].

### Physical examination

Physical examination findings in chronic mesenteric ischemia are often nonspecific and may include abdominal tenderness, a palpable abdominal mass, and a bruit over the epigastrium or flank [26793850]. In severe cases, patients may present with signs of acute mesenteric ischemia, such as abdominal distension, rebound tenderness, and absent bowel sounds [27825652]. Laboratory testing may reveal leukocytosis, anemia, and elevated lactate levels [26793850]. It is important to note that patients with vascular diseases often have complex medical histories, and electronic record systems may improve the quality and reliability of clinical data collection [29930621].

## DIAGNOSIS

### Imaging studies

Imaging studies are essential for the diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) [36781442]. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) is the most commonly used imaging modality for the diagnosis of CMI [36573778]. CTA can detect stenosis or occlusion of the mesenteric vessels, as well as collateral circulation between mesenteric vessels [36781442]. Retrograde open mesenteric stenting (ROMS) is a treatment option for mesenteric ischemia and can be used to assess the patency of the mesenteric vessels [36404451]. ROMS has a high rate of technical success and can be used to treat chronic atherosclerosis with or without in-situ thrombosis, superior mesenteric artery dissection, embolic, vasculitic, and nonocclusive ischemia [36404451].

### Diagnostic criteria

The diagnosis of chronic mesenteric ischemia can be made using a combination of clinical presentation, imaging studies, and invasive angiography [36436968]. Diagnostic criteria include the presence of postprandial abdominal pain, weight loss, and fear of eating, as well as imaging evidence of mesenteric artery stenosis or occlusion [36404064]. Duplex ultrasonography of the abdomen is a useful tool for investigating mesenteric artery pathology and can be used as a preliminary screening tool [36404064]. In patients with prior infrarenal aortic surgery, the risk of spinal cord ischemia should be considered when undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and/or complex EVAR [34742886]. The Society for Vascular Surgery Vascular Quality Initiative database recommends using multivariate regression to determine the independent predictors of postoperative SCI [34742886].

## NON-SURGICAL MANAGEMENT

### Lifestyle modifications

Lifestyle modifications are an important component of non-surgical management for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) [30286488]. Risk factors for CMI include smoking, hypertension, dyslipidemia, higher age, and female sex [30286488]. Patients with CMI may experience abdominal pain that is aggravated with food intake, abdominal bruits, and severe malnutrition [30286488]. To reduce the risk of CMI, patients should be advised to make lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising regularly [30286488]. Additionally, optimal medical therapy for risk reduction, including platelet inhibition, is indicated after revascularization [30286488].

### Pharmacologic therapy

Pharmacologic therapy for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) includes anticoagulant therapy, which is essential for patients with ischemic bowel disease [35090257]. The OVID study is currently investigating the use of prophylactic-dose enoxaparin in symptomatic ambulatory patients with COVID-19, a disease characterized by severe systemic, pulmonary, and vessel inflammation and coagulation activation [32907635]. Endovascular therapy, based on percutaneous angioplasty with or without stenting, can be effective for treating CMI, although it can have worse midterm and long-term results [34668486]. However, in cases of failure of conservative therapy, infrarenal transposition of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA) can be considered a safe and feasible surgical option with more physiologically favorable outcomes comparable to gastrointestinal bypasses [35475250].

## SURGICAL MANAGEMENT

### Open surgical revascularization

Open surgical revascularization has been the gold standard for the management of symptomatic chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) since 1958 [35143129]. However, from 1980 and the introduction of endovascular treatment, percutaneous angioplasty combined with stenting became the most common revascularization technique for CMI [34788652]. Despite the evolving revascularization techniques, AMI remains a morbid disease, and an open approach should remain the reference standard because it reduces the likelihood of bowel resection [34788652]. For CMI, an endovascular-first approach should be the standard of care with close surveillance [34788652]. In cases where endovascular treatment is not suitable, greater saphenous vein and/or prosthetic conduits are considered the first choice for open vascular bypass [34644634]. However, femoropopliteal vein (FPV) can be used as an alternative conduit for a variety of vascular reconstruction indications, almost universally available, and durable [34644634].

### Endovascular revascularization

Endovascular revascularization is generally recommended as the initial treatment for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) [36436968, 35143129]. This involves angioplasty and stent placement, which have become the most common revascularization techniques for CMI [35143129]. Surgical options, such as bypass or endarterectomy, are considered alternative options [36436968]. In the acute setting, endovascular interventions, including embolectomy, transcatheter thrombolysis, and angioplasty with or without stent placement, are recommended as initial therapeutic options [36436968].

The ACR Appropriateness Criteria are evidence-based guidelines for specific clinical conditions that are reviewed annually by a multidisciplinary expert panel [36436968]. The guideline development and revision process supports the systematic analysis of the medical literature from peer-reviewed journals. Established methodology principles such as Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation or GRADE are adapted to evaluate the evidence [36436968].

Although the diagnosis of median arcuate ligament syndrome remains controversial, diagnostic angiography can be helpful in rendering a diagnosis, with the preferred treatment option being a surgical release [36436968]. Systemic anticoagulation is recommended as initial

### Follow-up

After surgical intervention for chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI), long-term follow-up is crucial to monitor for recurrence and disease progression [36045857]. CT angiogram is the gold standard non-invasive investigation for confirming a CMI diagnosis. Referral to vascular surgery with early surgical intervention through angioplasty and stenting is crucial for improving patient outcomes [36045857].

A missed diagnosis of CMI can result in acute mesenteric infarction and bowel perforation which can cause severe morbidity and mortality [36045857]. Patients taking direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation are prone to anticoagulation failure and can present with thromboembolism [35233319].

For both acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) and CMI, open surgery has been associated with lower rates of bowel resection and improved outcomes [34788652]. However, endovascular interventions have improved postoperative morbidity for CMI, but have also resulted in early symptom recurrence and reintervention [34788652]. An endovascular-first approach should be the standard of care for CMI with close surveillance [34788652].

### Outcomes and complications of surgery

Surgical management of chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) has evolved with the increasing use of endovascular and hybrid methods [34788652]. An endovascular-first approach is recommended for CMI due to improved postoperative morbidity, but it is associated with early symptom recurrence and reintervention [34788652]. Open surgery remains the reference standard for acute mesenteric ischemia (AMI) as it reduces the likelihood of bowel resection [34788652]. Patients with prior infrarenal aortic repair undergoing thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) and/or complex endovascular aortic repair (EVAR) are a sicker cohort with higher 30-day mortality but have a comparable rate of spinal cord ischemia (SCI) to those without prior repair [34742886]. Predictors of postoperative morbidity, mortality, and patency loss for AMI and CMI include a history of diabetes, sepsis on presentation, chronic kidney disease, and inpatient status before revascularization [34788652]. Endovascular interventions for CMI have greater rates of symptom recurrence with a faster onset compared to bypass surgery [34788652]. Portal vein thrombosis (PVT) is a rare entity that may

## CONCLUSION

Chronic mesenteric ischemia (CMI) is a condition that results from narrowing or occlusion of the mesenteric vessels, leading to intestinal ischemia [36781442]. The collateral circulation between the celiac trunk (CT), superior mesenteric artery (SMA), and inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) plays a protective role against intestinal ischemia in case of narrowing or occlusion of the mesenteric vessels [36781442]. In patients with isolated CT or SMA stenosis or occlusion, mesenteric circulation is mainly provided by the gastroduodenal artery, while in patients with stenosis or occlusion of both CT and SMA, mesenteric circulation is mainly provided by the Riolan arch [36781442].

Postoperative intensive care treatment is an important part of the successful surgical treatment of Stanford type A aortic dissection (STAAD) [36713953]. Postoperative complications of STAAD may include mesenteric arterial embolism, which can lead to chronic mesenteric ischemia [36713953].

COVID-19 can be responsible for both acute and chronic embolic and thrombotic events in the mesenteric vasculature, which acts as a risk factor in the manifestation
